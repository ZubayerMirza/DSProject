    <h2>Does economic status affect mental health?</h2>
    <h3>What is the project about?</h3>
    <p>Depression is a mental illness that leads to emotional distress and lethargy. Such an illness is often unbearable and disrupts a person's life making it difficult to enjoy life. Low mental health can be caused by a myriad of factors both genetic and environmental. Medication and therapy are used to treat depression. However, adopting certain behaviors and habits can better help to manage mental distress. My hypothesis is that lower economic status can make you more depressed. After all, not being able to afford the quality of life you would like to live should in theory make you more unhappy.</p>
    <p>Using the NYC Community Health surveys, we can analyze if certain factors, such as level of income, and eating can lead to depression. By doing so, we hope to better understand the causes of depression and what we can do to mitigate it.</p>
